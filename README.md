- ## Approach 2:- Concatenation Check
    - ### Intuition
        - The problem is to determine if the string `goal` can be obtained by rotating the string `s`. A rotation involves moving characters from one end of the string to the other. By concatenating `s` with itself, we can easily check if `goal` exists as a substring within this new string, which would imply that `goal` is a rotation of `s`.

    - ### Approach
        1. **Length Check**: First, verify if the lengths of `s` and `goal` are the same. If they differ, return `false`, as `goal` cannot be a rotation of `s`.
        2. **Create Double String**: Concatenate `s` with itself to create `double_string`. This string contains all possible rotations of `s`.
        3. **Substring Search**: Use the `find()` method to check if `goal` is a substring of `double_string`. If found, it indicates that `goal` is indeed a rotation of `s`.

    - ### Time Complexity
        - **O(n)**: The algorithm primarily involves checking if `goal` is a substring of `double_string`. The `find()` method runs in linear time, where `n` is the length of the strings.

    - ### Space Complexity
        - **O(n)**: The space complexity is determined by the storage of `double_string`, which is twice the length of `s`. 

    - ### Code
        ```python3 []
        class Solution:
            def rotateString(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
                # Check if the lengths of 's' and 'goal' are different
                # If they are, 'goal' cannot be a rotation of 's'
                if len(s) != len(goal):
                    return False
                
                # Create a new string by concatenating 's' with itself
                double_string = s + s
                
                # Check if 'goal' is a substring of 'double_string'
                # If it is, return True; otherwise, return False
                return double_string.find(goal) != -1
        ```
        ```C++ []
        class Solution {
            public:
                bool rotateString(string s, string goal) {
                    // Check if the lengths of 's' and 'goal' are different
                    // If they are, 'goal' cannot be a rotation of 's'
                    if (s.length() != goal.length())
                        return false;
                    
                    // Create a new string by concatenating 's' with itself
                    string double_string = s + s;
                    
                    // Check if 'goal' is a substring of 'double_string'
                    // Using find() returns the index of 'goal' in 'double_string' if found,
                    // and the condition checks if the index is valid (less than the length of double_string)
                    return double_string.find(goal) < double_string.length();
                }
        };
        ```
